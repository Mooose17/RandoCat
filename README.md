# Randocat!

This app was created in a 24 hour challenge in which I attempted to create a simple react app.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To use this app, you need to provide the three input boxes three characters. This then queries the 'TheCatApi' to provide you with an adorable picture of a cat!

### Example:

- Letter 1: A
- Letter 2: A
- Letter 3: A

If this is queried you should see a picture of a ginger cat wearing a scarf.

If you were to input characters that do not provide a valid response from the 'TheCatAPI':

### Example:

- Letter 1: A
- Letter 2: S
- Letter 3: S

You will receive a message stating `'Oh No... This cat doesn't exist yet!'.`

## What is this?

Hello! This is a web-app that queries the [CatAPI](https://thecatapi.com/).

This app is hosted on netlify here: [RandoCat!](https://randocat.moose17.dev/)

## Requirements
