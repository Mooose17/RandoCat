# Randocat!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This app was created in a day and is by no means a finished project.
Currently the app was built and designed for browser first, meaning the next updates to this app will be looking at viewing this app and making it moblie responsive.

## What is this?
