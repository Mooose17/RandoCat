# Randocat!

This app was created in a 24 hour challenge in which I attempted to create a simple react app.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is this?

Hello! This is a web-app that queries the [CatAPI](https://thecatapi.com/).

This app is hosted on netlify here: [RandoCat!](https://randocat.moose17.dev/)

## Requirements
This React app runs version:

Node -v18.6.0

If you would like to run this repo locally:

Fork and Clone -git clone <insert-forked-url>
Run - Create-react-app in the root file
Install dependancies - npm install
Have fun!
